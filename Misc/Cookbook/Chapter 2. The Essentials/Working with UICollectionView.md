# Working with UICollectionView

UICollectionView is a very handy and awesome view when it comes to dealing with **grid layout**. 

iOS provides you with an abstract class-**UICollectionViewLayout**-which should be subclassed to customize how the content will be managed. 

You can create your own custom layouts and describe how you want to lay out your cells.
However, thanks to Apple, it provides us with a pre-made layout called **UICollectionViewFlowLayout**, which flow the layout by placing the cells one after the other based on their sizes and the spacing between them.
